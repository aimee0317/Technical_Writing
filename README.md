# Technical Report Writing 
### Author: Amelia Tang
This report is produced for UBC Master's of Data Science program DSCI 542 Communication and Argumentation based on my previous group project in DSCI 522 (github link here: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/canadian_heritage_funding). Some graphs and tables are updated to facilitate the writing of the report but the project content including the algorithm used remain unchanged.
