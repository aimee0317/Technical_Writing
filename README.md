## Report 1: UBC MDS DSCI 542 Data Science Project Report 
This report is produced for the UBC Master's of Data Science program DSCI 542 Communication and Argumentation course, based on my previous group project in DSCI 522. The project's GitHub link can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/canadian_heritage_funding).

In this report, some graphs and tables have been updated to facilitate the writing of the report, but the project's core content, including the algorithm used, remains unchanged.

The report can be accessed [here](Report1/doc/DSCI_542_Report.pdf).

## Report 2: Trustworthy ML on Healthcare Imaging Analysis
